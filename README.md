# Analyze-A-B-Test-Results
## Overviwe 
For this project, we will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Outcome
Based on the data of the new & old pages and after conducting analysis, there is no sufficient evidence to implement the new page, however, keeping on the old page is better. Moreover, the factor of visitor locations has no influence on this decision.
